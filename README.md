# To run locally 

## INSTRUCTIONS : -
- Download the git repository.
- Delete the "package-lock.json" file.
- Open cmd/windows powershell in same directory and run “npm install”.
- In case of any ERROR, try again and again deleting the partially created "node_modules" folder and "package-lock.json".( in case they are created)
- If error persists, try changing proxy settings of your computer (this hack may work).
- When everything is successfully installed, run “npm run start” in the same directory. (Hopefully site will launch)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]



### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
